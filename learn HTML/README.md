# Step 1

HTML elements have an opening and closing tag with content between.

Here is the basic syntax:

```
<openingTag>content</openingTag>
```

The first element you will learn about is the `h1` element. The `h1` element is a heading and is used for the main heading of a webpage.

```
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
```

# Step 2

The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance so, `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements.

```
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least most important heading element</h6>
```

Only use one `h1` element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

# Step 3

The `p` element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites.

```
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

# Step 4

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with `<!--`, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with `-->`

Here is an example of a comment with the `TODO: Remove h1`

```
<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->
```
